# operator-dashboard
A learning project to visualize data in a dashboard application for operators

## Setup

### Install Node.js
This project is built using Node.js, and to do development or testing requires an install of Node.js v12.3 or higher. Instructions for installation can be found at https://nodejs.org/en/.

## Tools
- [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/), a simple templating language.
- [Highcharts JS](https://www.highcharts.com/), an easy to use and battle tested JavaScript charting library. A natural choice for me as I have been a Highcharts developer for many years.
- [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/), a minimal and flexible web application framework.
- [Underscore.js](https://underscorejs.org/), a javascript library providing functional programming helpers.

## Sidenotes
Since this is a project for learning, and not intended for a serious use case, then I am skipping tests to speed up development. In a serious use case I would stress the need for testing.
I would choose a unit testing framework, for instance [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) or [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), to test that the functions is producing the expected results, and use for instance [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) to test web application.
